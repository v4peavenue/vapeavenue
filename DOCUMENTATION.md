# Agos — Architectural & Operational Documentation

Welcome to the official developer and operator documentation for **Agos**. This document serves as a comprehensive system guide, outlining the application’s design patterns, database architecture, multi-tier pricing, code modules, visual systems, and backup/restore workflows.

---

## 1. APPLICATION OVERVIEW

### App Name & Purpose
* **App Name:** Agos
* **Purpose:** A robust, real-time, full-featured retail management application designed to handle multi-branch retail operations, rapid barcoded point-of-sale checkout, dynamic multi-tier customer pricing, automated ledger-grade bookkeeping, purchase order orchestration, and store employee attendance logs.

### Core Value Proposition
This platform is built for fast-paced retail environments (such as electronics, vape and e-cigarette specialty shops, or boutique storefronts) looking to bridge the gap between brick-and-mortar register activities and cloud-synchronized executive reporting. It eliminates discrepancies in cash registers, automates stock-level tracking across sub-locations, manages purchase order cycles with suppliers, and tracks employee performance—all from a single, unified interface that runs smoothly on both modern desktop environments and mobile tablets.

### Key Workflows
1. **Dynamic Storefront Checkout (POS):** 
   Cashiers initiate high-speed transactions by adding items via fuzzy-search or scan inputs. The system queries active promotions and identifies customer-specific price tiers in real time. Transactions automatically split computed prices into VAT tax portions (using standard 12% calculation), handle split-method payments, update inventory levels on success, and push entries directly to the historical sales journals.
2. **Double-Entry Ledger Bookkeeping (Finance):** 
   Financial managers log account profiles (operational cash flow, vault storage, card processing accounts, accounts payable), record capital deposits/expenses, track real-time margin ratios, and perform store reconciliation exercises.
3. **Purchase Ordering & Stock Intake (Purchasing & Stock Adjustments):**
   When dynamic inventory counts slide below a custom warning threshold, managers draft Purchase Orders (PO) assigned to suppliers, approve order arrivals to instantly increment product quantities, and log precise manual overrides with documented audit justifications.
4. **Employee Verification and Shift Logs (Attendance):**
   Employees verification via individual logins, clocking in and clocking out with timestamp receipts to compile real-time, payroll-ready reports of regular and overtime hours.
5. **Data Protection and Redundancy Control (Backup & Settings):**
   Administrators can construct offline JSON snapshot archives representing the complete state of the retail database in one-click, and perform clean database restores to resolve data corruption or switch database instances.

## 2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & TECH STACK

### Tech Stack
* **Core Layout Framework:** [React 18+](https://react.dev/) integrated with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for high-speed compilation and client bundling.
* **Component Utility Library:** Custom UI structures compiled via [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility classes, with a fluid design paradigm and structural typography paired with the functional `@import "tailwindcss";` compiler.
* **Real-time Synchronization Engine:** [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) for active-sync document pipelines, multi-document batch operations, and snapshot state hooks.
* **Identity Management:** Google Firebase Authentication for credential verification and secure session persistence.
* **Icon Representation Set:** Icons sourced uniformly from the [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) library.

### State Management
* **Global Access Patterns:** Global system states—including session status, logged-in profiles, authorization clearances, and offline parameters—are handled by a high-level React Context Provider, `AuthContext.tsx`.
* **Real-time Synchronization Subscription:** The pages register active listener handles with `onSnapshot` queries to bind directly with Cloud Firestore. When an asset, transaction, or setting document shifts at the backend level, React components render changes dynamically, reflecting the accurate state instantly.
* **Ref/State Instacing:** To prevent layout lag, state arrays (e.g., active POS cart, quick barcode scans) run locally inside page-specific hooks. Direct commits write to the database in atomic actions (e.g., `writeBatch()`) to prevent partial failures in data consistency.

## 4. USER GUIDE & INTERFACES

### Screen-by-Screen Breakdown

#### 1. POS Registry Checkout (`/src/pages/POS.tsx`)
* **What the Cashier Sees:** A dual-column register view. The left-hand segment holds product groupings, search boxes, category filters, and product grid cards with live pricing. The right-hand segment displays the transaction cart, tax calculations (12% VAT), and quick-action payment keys.
* **Interaction Flow:** Scanning a barcode instantly pulls product details into the cart. Selecting a custom account matches their designated Price Tier, automatically recalculating sub-totals. Cashiers click `Pay`, confirm the cash/card/split allocation, and hit complete. The transaction is instantly pushed to Firestore, updating database quantities and logging financial entries in real-time.

#### 2. Inventory and Multi-Tier Catalogs (`/src/pages/Inventory.tsx`)
* **What the Inspector Sees:** A density-optimized listing containing warning chips for items running below minimum stock. Features tools for creating, editing, and deleting products.
* **Component Form:** Product details allow assigning dynamic, tier-specific selling variables directly. This allows a product with standard pricing of $100 to be assigned individual tier costs: $90 for VIP customers, and $85 for internal staff.

#### 3. General Ledger Business Hub (`/src/pages/Finance.tsx`)
* **What the Auditor Sees:** Accounts summary cards (Cash, Vault, Bank accounts) showing real-time ledger balances. The page holds active forms to record deposits and expenses, alongside structural tables displaying transactional histories (Capital Injections, Operating Costs, Rent, Utilities).

#### 4. Settings & Database Control Panel (`/src/pages/Settings.tsx`)
* **What the Admin Sees:** Business rules configuration (Tax margins, Currency preferences), Go-Live Production reset mechanics, and the master **Database Backup & Restore** cards.
* **The Backup Mechanism:** Clicking `Export JSON Backup` serializes each database document across all standard collections (e.g., products, sales, customers, directories, audit logs) into a single, structured backup JSON. It serializes complex datatypes (such as Firestore's Timestamp) safely into structured properties.
* **The Restore Process:** Select a local JSON file, opt for either **Merge & Update (Safe)** or **Pure Overwrite (Clean Replace)**, input the string confirmation `RESTORE`, and launch. The interface utilizes atomic Firestore batches of up to 400 entries per pipeline to ensure consistent restores.

---

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

* **Missing Key Offsets / Offline Local Mode:** If cloud Firestore initialization behaves as blocked, the application displays a descriptive link enabling admins to run POS routines entirely inside an integrated **Offline Sandbox Mode**.
* **Zero or Empty Form Triggers:** Form submission is guarded by validation checks at the user interface level, preventing broken configurations from reaching database fields.
* **Network & Database Outages:** Firewalls and network timeouts are caught gracefully. Database processes present retry triggers alongside clean indicators via `/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` to prevent complete viewport failures.

## 5. LOCAL SETUP & DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

### Prerequisites
1. **NodeJS Engine:** A modern version of standard runtime NodeJS installed locally (Node LTS version 18 or superior is strongly recommended).
2. **Environment Key Values:** Configure `.env` using `.env.example` as a template. Note that keys must NOT run client side prefixes unless deliberately required:
   ```env
   # Firebase Cloud Core Configurations
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_core_api_key_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
   ```

### Installation Steps

Execute this sequential script sequence inside your terminal to pull, mount, and launch this POS setup inside your workspace:

```bash
# 1. Access project workspace directory
cd parent-folder/pos-inventory-suite

# 2. Install all necessary dependencies declared inside package.json
npm install

# 3. Boot the local development hot reload server
npm run dev
```

The system will initialize a local dev server, accessible directly at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Deployment Instructions

#### Deploying on Vercel:
1. Initialize a Git repository, commit clean tracking files, and push them upstream to GitHub.
2. Link your repository with a new project in your **Vercel Dashboard**.
3. Apply these settings in the project configurations:
   * **Framework Preset:** `Vite`
   * **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   * **Output Directory:** `dist`
4. Copy all required keys and parameters from your local `.env` file, paste them into the **Environment Variables** panel in Vercel settings, and trigger build.
